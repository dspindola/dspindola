I'm a <span style="color:#F2E088">software engineer</span> and <span style="color: #F2E088">open-source developer</span> with a focus on web tooling and developer experience. My work centers around creating intuitive, powerful tools that make development more efficient and enjoyable.

I'm particularly passionate about browser/web applications and shell apps that push the boundaries of what's possible in these environments. My commitment to <span style="color: #F2E088">free</span> software isn't just professionalâ€”it's philosophical. I believe technology should be:

- _Accessible_ to everyone, regardless of ability or circumstance
- Built to foster _connectivity_ between people and communities
- Designed for [_social development_](https://docs.bsky.app/), creating positive impacts beyond individual users

Through my projects, I aim to contribute to a more open, inclusive technological landscape where powerful tools are available to all developers, not just those with access to expensive proprietary solutions.
